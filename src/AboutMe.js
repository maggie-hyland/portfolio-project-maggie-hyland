    <div class="col">
    Currently, I am a skilled dental hygienist with a passion for learning and a desire to take on new challenges. I have made the decision to transition my career to front-end web development and I've found the process of learning to code to be quite enjoyable! In my personal life, I enjoy kayaking with my husband, exploring diverse culinary experiences, and listening to plenty of sci-fi audiobooks. I have a chunky black cat that I get to spoil, and I hope to potentially acquire more kitties in the future!
