            Hi, I'm Maggie! I am a skilled dental hygienist with a passion for
            learning and a desire to take on new challenges. I've made the
            decision to transition my career to front-end web development and I
            have found the process of learning to code to be quite enjoyable! In
            my personal life, I enjoy kayaking with my husband, exploring
            diverse culinary experiences, and listening to plenty of sci-fi
            audiobooks. I have a chunky black cat that I get to spoil, and I
            hope to potentially acquire more kitties in the future!
